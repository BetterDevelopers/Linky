# Linky

Easily share links and booksmarks with firends and colleagues...

## Sample Data

You can find a sample of what the data will look like in `sampleData.json`

## Sample API

I have used a fake api inside `src/components/Blogs.js` to show how we might fetch and render data.

## Routing

There are a few basic routes and examples of utilising URL params with routing.

## Developing

To get the dev server running:

- clone this repo with `git clone blablablabla`
- install dependencies by running `yarn`
- run `yarn start` from the project root

The app is now running in development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Hot reloading is available so any changes you make will cause the browser to reload.

## Production

Running `yarn build` from route will build a production ready version of the app inside the `build` folder.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
App is now ready to be deployed
